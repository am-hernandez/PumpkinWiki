    A pumpkin is a cultivar of winter squash that 
    is round with smooth, slightly ribbed skin, and is most often 
    deep yellow to orange in coloration. The thick shell contains 
    the seeds and pulp. The name is most commonly used for cultivars 
    of Cucurbita pepo, but some cultivars of Cucurbita maxima, 
    C. argyrosperma, and C. moschata with similar appearance are also 
    sometimes called "pumpkin".

    Native to North America (northeastern Mexico and the southern 
    United States), pumpkins are one of the oldest domesticated 
    plants, having been used as early as 7,500 to 5,000 BC. Pumpkins 
    are widely grown for commercial use and as food, aesthetics, and 
    recreational purposes. Pumpkin pie, for instance, is a traditional 
    part of Thanksgiving meals in Canada and the United States, and 
    pumpkins are frequently carved as jack-o'-lanterns for decoration 
    around Halloween, although commercially canned pumpkin pur√©e and 
    pumpkin pie fillings are usually made from different kinds of winter 
    squash than the ones used for jack-o'-lanterns. China and India 
    combined account for half of the world's production of pumpkins.
